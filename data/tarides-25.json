Immutable Arrays","id":"I_kwDOG5OS8s5-79by","number":662,"body":"# Upstream Immutable Arrays\n\n\n## Goal\n\nThis project is about taking the immutable arrays feature developed at Jane Street and integrating it into the upstream compiler. Immutable arrays improve on regular arrays in several ways:\n\n\n\n* If a particular use-case does not require mutation -- instead needing only random-access packed memory -- then an immutable array conveys this fact more clearly than the use of an ordinary array.\n* An immutable array improves reasoning properties: we know a function cannot change its contents.\n* Immutable arrays can safely be covariant, unlike mutable ones.\n\n\n### KR\n\n\n\n1. Immutable array StdLib modules are upstreamed to ocaml/ocaml\n2. Immutable array literal syntax is upstreamed to ocaml/ocaml\n3. Jane Street‚Äôs `iarray` library compiles with the upstream compiler\n4. Upstream changes to immutable arrays are downstreamed to flambda-backend\n\n\n### How to measure this KR\n\n**Primary success criterion:**\n\nThe immutable-array stdlib modules (plain and with labels) are integrated into the upstream stdlib, with necessary compiler support. The code in the modules should use immutable-array literal syntax (e.g. `[: ... :]`) instead of the current conversion from regular array syntax. The version merged upstream would naturally not have any of the locals-oriented functions. The work will necessarily include updating the OCaml manual.\n\n**Secondary success criteria:**\n\n* Jane Street's `iarray` library compiles with the upstream compiler. This library is not currently open-source, but Jane Street can provide the source code for it. It will be integrated into the `base` library once support for immutable arrays exists upstream.\n* If the design of the feature changes in the course of upstreaming, these changes are integrated into Jane Street's branch of the compiler.\n\n\n## Design\n\nThe brunt of the work would be in upstreaming the patch that implements immutable arrays. An important part of the work would be staging and pushing through any debate with other upstream maintainers.\n\nJane Street engineers will be active collaborators in this process, with an individual (likely Richard Eisenberg) in charge of helping Tarides complete this task. In particular, while we would like Tarides to post the patch and help move the debate along (e.g. pinging others when the conversation dies down), we expect to contribute to any design discussions, possibly updating our design to match what upstream requests. Since only the Jane Street engineers have experience using the feature at scale, Jane Street engineers will co-draft the PR message with the Tarides engineers to ensure that the motivation for the feature comes through well. This is essential for the feature to be favourably seen upstream.\n\nThere may be later patches that include bugfixes; part of the work would be looking through the flambda-backend repo for patches that affect immutable arrays (searching for \"immutable\" or \"iarray\" should be sufficient). This maintenance work to be done after the work contained in this proposal is considered complete may be included in the [2024 compiler maintenance proposal.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o7jrg8l41qxGPhF3mXl0WFhbqDd0662aR71daTtCric/edit?pli=1#heading=h.izr6qe3mf0wt) \n\n\n### Challenges\n\n\n\n* Duplication of code\n    * The approach required by Jane Street duplicates the code between iarray.ml and iarrayLabels.ml which, according to the note on the top of the file, is due to not being able to `include Iarray` when building with Dune. This limitation does not exist with Make builds, and thus, the duplication may not be justifiable upstream.\n* The usual challenge with upstreaming\n    * Getting the PRs to an upstream acceptable state will require careful work, including preparation at the core developer meetings.\n    * Getting the PRs accepted will require gaining approvals from non-Tarides upstream core developers. The approvers are implicitly expected to continue maintaining the feature. \n* Syntax\n    * As with any syntactic addition, there is likely to be hesitance to add syntax for a feature whose pervasiveness is unclear. Getting immutable arrays without the syntactic addition is relatively easier. \n\n\n### Deliverables\n\n\n\n* PRs to ocaml/ocaml upstreaming immutable arrays stdlib parts\n    * Including documentation\n* PRs to ocaml/ocaml upstreaming immutable arrays syntax\n    * Including documentation\n* PRs to flambda-backend downstreaming upstream changes to immutable arrays\n\n\n## Effort\n\n\n\n* 0.3 Senior Software Engineer * 13 weeks\n\n\n### Justification\n\nThe effort estimate needs to provide sufficient time to \n\n\n\n1. Onboard on the Jane Street fork and the immutable array implementation\n2. Prepare a solid case for each PR\n3. Several revisions for each PR\n4. Benchmarking and validation\n\n\n## Priority\n\nMedium\n\n\n### Why?\n\nWe would like to use immutable arrays in the interfaces in our open-source libraries. This will clarify the interfaces, and there may be opportunities for improvement regarding the ability for immutable arrays to be covariant. There is no pressing need, but we're finding that we sometimes have to design a suboptimal interface because of the lack of immutable arrays upstream.\n\n\n## Timeline\n\nJane Street would like to see an initial PR implementing the changes in the upstream compiler by early Q2. Concretely - as it is not considered a complicated new feature - they estimate seven days of initial implementation work with a concentrated effort during the first week, with the rest spread out over a month, followed by a long tail of reviews and revisions leading to PR approval, during which Tarides and engineers continue to lead the effort with Jane Street engineers participating on demand when deemed helpful.\n\n\n## JS Bucket\n\n\n\n1.

These\nassertions are only checked in the \"debug\" runtime (which also has\nadditional checking code protected by `#ifdef DEBUG`), so that the\ndefault runtime has smaller code size and higher performance. However,\nthis means that the assertions are not often checked as almost\neveryone, including Tarides developers, almost always, runs the\ndefault runtime. This means that defects which break the checked\ninvariants can lurk undiscovered for some time.\n\nThere is good experimental evidence from other projects that almost\nall runtime checks have no measurable effect on performance, so the\nintention of this project is to turn on almost all assertions in the\ndefault runtime. A very small effect on performance may be a\nworthwhile price for the additional checking.\n\nA few assertions may turn out to be be performance critical - a\ndifferent macro should be used for these, so (like the `#ifdef DEBUG`\nsections) they are compiled out of the default runtime.\n\nThe idea has been discussed during January's core dev meeting in\nLondon and got a positive response from developers.\n\nBecause assertions are rarely checked, it is not a good idea to just\nsuddenly turn them on. There will inevitably be some third-party code\nsomewhere which exercises the runtime in a particularly unusual way,\nunlike anything at Tarides and trips over an incorrect assertion. So\nthe intention is for `CAMLassert` to remain as it is, while we\nintroduce a new macro.

(rarely) converted to the new performance-critical macro, so it is\n   only checked in the debug runtime.\n\nAt the same time, additional assertions may be added, using one or\nother of the new macros.\n```[tasklist]\n### Tasks\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/workitems/issues/1137\n```\n","url":"https://github.com/tarides/objectives/issues/680","state":"OPEN"},{"title":"ORCHIDE: Mirage on Unikraft","id":"I_kwDOG5OS8s6DpK8z","number":682,"body":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-4CQlXn0l3sQju-Nh_SC30644B53VYiFqVTTc_D9NmY/edit?usp=sharing\n```[tasklist]\n### Tasks\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/workitems/issues/1131\n```\n","url":"https://github.com/tarides/objectives/issues/682","state":"CLOSED"},{"title":"General DWARF support in OCaml","id":"I_kwDOG5OS8s6D4OoX","number":684,"body":"```[tasklist]\r\n### Work Items\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/workitems/issues/1132\r\n```\r\n","url":"https://github.com/tarides/objectives/issues/684","state":"OPEN"},{"title":"Chainable atomic structures for Saturn","id":"I_kwDOG5OS8s6EwwB-","number":691,"body":"```[tasklist]\n### Tasks\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/workitems/issues/1148\n```\n","url":"https://github.com/tarides/objectives/issues/691","state":"OPEN"},{"title":"Kcas: composable data structures","id":"I_kwDOG5OS8s6EwwMU","number":692,"body":"```[tasklist]\n### Tasks\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/workitems/issues/1147\n```\n","url":"https://github.com/tarides/objectives/issues/692","state":"OPEN"},{"title":"Maintenance -

It's already possible to tell TSan not to report data races on certain functions using an environment variable [TSan suppressions](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerSuppressions), but this is not very practical, has to be supplied on each program execution, and can't be part of the code itself.\r\nA more user friendly (i.e. as a library user) solution would be to add a new OCaml attribute `no_tsan`, which modifes the actual (assembly) code emitted so that memory accesses wouldn't be notified to TSan, and so, no data race is detected. Note the difference, while TSan suppressions data race reports from being displayed, a `no_tsan` attribute would prevent TSan from seeing the actual race (and so there's no TSan book-keeping overhead).\r\nFor example, a record field mutation could be annotated `no_tsan` so that the memory store isn't notified to TSan.

This is achieved by backporting the non-multicore-specific changes to flambda-backend. We will start with the most recent release of the vanilla OCaml compiler i.e., OCaml 5.1. The flambda-backend is based on 4.14.1.\n\nIt is indeed the case that backporting 5.x non-multicore changes over to flambda-backend will make the flambda-backend diverge from the vanilla 4.14 compiler. But this is ok since Jane Street‚Äôs OCaml compiler does not need to be tied specifically to the features that are only available in a particular version of the vanilla OCaml compiler. \n\nMoreover, backporting changes will make Jane Street move quickly from 4.14 to 5.x since the diff will be smaller.

This is the layer necessary to then build those. The porting of the runtime would be done without providing a Unix module and/or a POSIX layer, doing that in SP would not be hard, but for MP would, since the final target is MirageOS where we want to do more in OCaml, this saves us work. \n\nOnce this KR is achieved, we either dive into MP or go to MirageOS, which road to take should be clearer in the future. How to tie MirageOS to this layer will require first deciding if we go MP before or not, the MirageOS device APIs needs to change in order for MP to be a reality, this will involve interactions with the community and that makes no sense until we have all the technical bits of this KR defined.

This work will also stretch Unikraft in places it hasn't been tested or even used, it's unclear how many problems we will face. For instance, strncpy(3) had a bug :/. Another minor (hopefully largely resolved) is dealing with kraftkit, which is a pretty undocumented, yet core tool of Unikraft.\nDeliverables\nUnikraft environment and devices initialization, we have to do some of it ourselves since we won‚Äôt be using the layers that usually do this by themselves, for example the network devices are brought up by lwip (their embedded network stack), which we won‚Äôt use, therefore we have to do it ourselves.

We will execute this by adapting the successful js_of_ocaml compiler toolchain. The outcome is a compiler that can produce faster and more performance-predictable web application code than js_of_ocaml. \n\nEventually, wasm_of_ocaml is planned to be merged into the js_of_ocaml codebase. The work necessary for such a merge is not included in the current scope of work. This will have to be scoped as a follow up based on the outcome of the current scope of work.\n \n**KRs**\nWasm_of_ocaml passes (a) js_of_ocaml‚Äôs test suite of programs and (b) Jane Street‚Äôs Wasm acceptance test suite.\nHow to measure this KR\nRun wasm_of_ocaml on the test suite of programs and confirm that the test suite passes.\n\nThe part of the Wasm acceptance test suite built by Jane Street will be provided to Tarides either as open-source code or made available privately to Tarides. \n\n\n**Design**\nWebAssembly\n[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) (Wasm) is a binary instruction format, designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the Web for client and server applications. It provides a sandboxed execution environment, which also makes it attractive for both blockchains and Cloud deployment. For example, Fastly's [Compute@Edge platform](https://docs.fastly.com/products/compute-at-edge) is based on WebAssembly.\n\nThe [WebAssembly Core specification](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/) is currently very low level: the memory is an array of bytes. This makes it hard to interoperate with the outside world. One has to go through JavaScript to manipulate the DOM, and one has to explicitly keep track of pointers to JavaScript values. So, WebAssembly is currently mostly used for performance-critical tasks or as a sandboxed execution environment. It would not be possible to develop a large Web application in WebAssembly.\n\nThe [Garbage collection proposal](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/blob/main/proposals/gc/MVP.md) aims to improve on this. It provides heap-allocated data structures, which are garbage collected and can directly contain references to foreign values. Our hope is that it will eventually provide an alternative to JavaScript, with more consistent and better performances.\n\nWasm has [additional proposals for extensions](https://github.com/WebAssembly/proposals) at different stages of development. We would like to make sure that these proposals satisfy the needs of the OCaml community, and having a working prototype would give us more confidence and leverage. In particular, the following proposals are relevant for the OCaml community:\n\n- exception handling\n- stack switching\n- JS Promise Integration\n- tail call\n- threads\n- reference-typed strings\n\nWe hope that we can encourage the deployment of these extensions by demonstrating that we are ready to take advantage of them.\n\n\n**Scope**\nTo avoid having to include a GC with every compiled application, we plan to target the [Garbage collection](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc) proposal. This extension is already available under Google Chrome (used by Jane Street) but may take some more time before it is more widely adopted. The result should enable Chrome users to deploy OCaml applications on the Web with better and more predictable performance than when compiling them to JavaScript using js_of_ocaml. \n\nWe would rely on the following additional extensions:\n[exception handling](https://github.com/WebAssembly/exception-handling/blob/main/proposals/exception-handling/Exceptions.md) ([widely implemented](https://webassembly.org/roadmap/))\n[tail call](https://github.com/WebAssembly/tail-call/blob/main/proposals/tail-call/Overview.md) (standardised feature, though [not widely implemented yet](https://webassembly.org/roadmap/))\n[reference-typed strings](https://github.com/WebAssembly/stringref/blob/main/proposals/stringref/Overview.md) (phase 1, implemented in Chrome behind the flag --experimental-wasm-stringref)\n\nDepending on the evolution of the availability of these extensions, we may reconsider this choice, and implement workarounds. The exception handling extension is crucial for compiling typical OCaml code. Tail-calls would be really nice to have, though the Js_of_ocaml experience has shown that we can often do without. Reference-typed strings just provide a convenient way to convert strings between OCaml and JavaScript.\n\n\n**Challenges**\n\nClosure conversion\nContrary to JavaScript, Wasm only provides closed functions. So we will need to add a closure conversion phase to deal explicitly with function environments.\nStructured control flow\nWe know from js_of_ocaml how to recover a structured control flow since JavaScript does not have a goto instruction. The fact that the bytecode compiler does not generate irreducible control flow makes this easier. Norman Ramsey has recently published [a nice paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3547621) on how GHC's Wasm backend achieves this.\n\nTail calls\nThere is a [Wasm proposal to support tail calls](https://github.com/WebAssembly/tail-call/blob/master/proposals/tail-call/Overview.md) (in phase 4) which we plan to use for a start. Alternatively, we can just optimize tail recursion (by introducing a loop), and possibly tail calls between mutually recursive functions by inserting a trampoline, as is done by js_of_ocaml.\n\nExceptions\nWe plan to implement exceptions using the [Exception handling proposal](https://github.com/WebAssembly/exception-handling/blob/main/proposals/exception-handling/Exceptions.md) which is already widely supported. \n\nEffect handlers\n[Effect handlers](https://v2.ocaml.org/manual/effects.html) permit non-local control-flow in the program and is useful for implementing user-level concurrency without having to simulate it through a monad. In OCaml, they rely on the runtime providing support for fibers ‚Äì lightweight stack segments managed by the runtime. Such runtime support is not currently available either in the JavaScript engines or in the Wasm runtimes. \n\nJs_of_ocaml supports [effect handlers](https://github.com/ocsigen/js_of_ocaml/pull/1340) through a static analysis guided [selective](https://github.com/ocsigen/js_of_ocaml/pull/1384) CPS translation. As with any static analysis, the analysis of when to CPS is imprecise, and the implementation errs towards CPS translating code when there is lack of precision. CPS translation incurs overheads which are more than non-CPS path. Currently, this is an opt-in feature and is likely to remain so.\n\nGiven that wasm_of_ocaml builds on top of js_of_ocaml‚Äôs core, effect handlers will be supported out of the box from the get go through the CPS translation. This makes it possible to run recent concurrency libraries such as [Eio](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio) in Wasm. That said, given the cost of CPS translation, this support will be opt-in. The work on local types at Jane Street can also be used to augment the static analysis and make it more precise.\n\nIn the future, the support for effect handlers in Wasm will be implemented on top of the [Stack switching proposal](https://github.com/WebAssembly/stack-switching/blob/main/proposals/continuations/Overview.md). Given that the stack switching proposal is only in Phase 0, it is likely to be a few years before this is possible. An alternative solution of effect handlers will be implementing then on top of the [JS Promise Integration](https://github.com/WebAssembly/js-promise-integration/blob/main/proposals/js-promise-integration/Overview.md), which is implemented by Chrome today. Either way, the support for effect handlers is likely to be opt-in.\nInterfacing with JavaScript\nWe should be able to reuse the JavaScript bindings already written for js_of_ocaml. They will need to be adapted to deal with the fact that integers and floats are conflated in a single type in JavaScript, but other conversions are explicit. \n\nWe plan to use the [Reference-Typed Strings](https://github.com/WebAssembly/stringref/blob/main/proposals/stringref/Overview.md) proposal for converting between Javascript UTF-16 strings and OCaml strings. This is convenient since we do not have to implement the conversion ourselves. We may reconsider this if the proposal does not become more widely implemented.\n\nJane Street uses a number of runtime library dependencies that are critical for wasm_of_ocaml to be a drop-in replacement. This includes the js_of_ocaml library, Gen_js_api and a number of JavaScript runtime files as part of zarith, bigstring, base and async. With wasm_of_ocaml, we should be able to reuse the existing JavaScript libraries by writing suitable Wasm bindings when possible, or rewriting them in Wasm when writing Wasm bindings to JavaScript is likely to be more work. \n\nInterfacing with C / Rust\nIt should not be difficult to interface with C or Rust code by manually writing stub code in WebAssembly to handle the calling convention mismatch.\nIt should also be possible to implement ctypes, since libffi [has been ported](https://github.com/hoodmane/libffi-emscripten) to Webassembly.\nOne could also compile existing C bindings with minimal changes using appropriate macro definitions, by making use of Clang 17‚Äôs [support for reference types](https://reviews.llvm.org/D122215). There are a lot of engineering issues to consider, in particular:\n\n- How do we specify which C functions are available to ctypes\n- How do we tell whether an OCaml external definition refers to a Wasm or C stub function\n- What is the compilation and link process\n\n**Alternative designs considered**\n\nRoll out our own GC\nAn alternative design would not depend on the Wasm GC proposal, but instead compile OCaml‚Äôs GC to Wasm using LLVM, effectively including a GC per application, that has to play together with a JavaScript engine‚Äôs GC. With the Wasm GC extension already implemented in Chrome, this route was deemed more future proof after discussions with Leo White and Mark Shinwell.\n\nFlambda-to-wasm\nAnother alternative design would be to modify the OCaml compiler to directly generate Webassembly code. This is the approach taken by the [flambda-to-wasm prototype compiler](https://github.com/chambart/flambda-to-wasmgc). This way, one can take advantage of the optimizations performed by the native code compiler to generate a better code. The current implementation of flambda-to-wasm is based off flambda1 and will be moved to flambda2 next. Jane Street is in the process of deploying flambda2 internally.\n\nA disadvantage of the flambda2 based compiler is that the flambda2 IR is yet to be upstreamed to OCaml. This makes it harder for the community to take advantage of Wasm compilation support. With wasm_of_ocaml, because it is built on the widely used js_of_ocaml compiler, the community can install packages from OPAM and then target Wasm. We believe that this is a good starting point for opening up the Wasm ecosystem to the OCaml users. \n\nNow there is the question of how one might transition from wasm_of_ocaml to a future flambda2 based Wasm compiler. Firstly, a large part of the implementation effort in the proposal lies in the implementation of the runtime system support in Wasm. This work being done in this proposal can be reused by the future flambda2 based compiler. A good analogy for the situation is the OCaml compiler itself. The OCaml compiler has a bytecode mode (wasm_of_ocaml) and a native mode (flambda2-to-wasm), but shares almost all of the runtime system implementation. Because of optimisations such as unboxing in flambda2, the runtime representation of OCaml values between the flambda2-based compiler and wasm_of_ocaml will be different and there is no binary compatibility between the code produced by the two compilers ‚Äì you cannot freely pass OCaml values between the two as their representations may be different. Hence the switch from using wasm_of_ocaml to flambda2-based compiler will need to be a wholesale one.\n\n\n**Deliverables**\nWe propose to break the project into the following deliverables:\n\n1. Support enough of OCaml to compile a simple program to Wasm and run it\n2. Grow OCaml language support with:\n - first-order data (base types int, float, string, char, ..., list, array, ..., and variants and records)\n - partially applied functions (closure conversion)\n - exception support\n3. Core runtime environment\n - Implement enough of the runtime environment to support basic types, including polymorphic comparison and hashing\n4. Support enough of OCaml to compile and run a selection of benchmark programs\n5. Implement JavaScript bindings. [Camlboy](https://github.com/linoscope/CAMLBOY) can be used as a test.\n6. Integrate with the ecosystem and improve the compilation process\n - dune support\n - update [Brr](https://erratique.ch/software/brr) and [gen_js_api](https://github.com/LexiFi/gen_js_api)\n - support separate compilation\n7. Broaden the runtime environment. In particular:\n - Marshalling\n - lexing/parsing\n - Bigarrays\n - file system access\n8. Compare resulting performance with that of ocamlopt and ocamlc and optimize it\n - implement unboxed float arrays\n - try to eliminate unnecessary casts and boxing operations\n - implement more efficient JavaScript bindings\n9. Test suite coverage:\n - Implement the features necessary to cover the js_of_ocaml test suite\n - Implement the features necessary to cover the Jane Street‚Äôs Wasm acceptance test suite. This is predicated on Jane Street - -    - making available a Wasm acceptance test suite.\n```[tasklist]\n### Tasks\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/roadmap/issues/410\n```\n","url":"https://github.com/tarides/objectives/issues/532","state":"CLOSED"},{"title":"Odoc Supports Search","id":"I_kwDOG5OS8s5yyvOi","number":533,"body":"```[tasklist]\n### Tasks\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/roadmap/issues/243\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/roadmap/issues/242\n```\n","url":"https://github.com/tarides/objectives/issues/533","state":"CLOSED"},{"title":"Picos: Interoperable effect-based concurrency","id":"I_kwDOG5OS8s5y7XgZ","number":536,"body":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NoTUBrh0KhJjQYJx78fCnXK2hC6U5JLWKRftpQUJ0_4/edit?usp=sharing\n```[tasklist]\n### WIs\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/roadmap/issues/1056\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/roadmap/issues/1086\n```\n","url":"https://github.com/tarides/objectives/issues/536","state":"OPEN"},{"title":"Odoc Performance Scales to Jane Street Codebase","id":"I_kwDOG5OS8s5y9Bz4","number":537,"body":"```[tasklist]\n### Tasks\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/roadmap/issues/1096\n```\n","url":"https://github.com/tarides/objectives/issues/537","state":"OPEN"},{"title":"Scope the amount of work to create an Eio based key-value store","id":"I_kwDOG5OS8s5zOD1g","number":538,"body":"","url":"https://github.com/tarides/objectives/issues/538","state":"OPEN"},{"title":"A race-free runtime with TSan","id":"I_kwDOG5OS8s5zOihv","number":539,"body":"**Goal**\nData races represent a nasty class of bugs, to the point that [JaneStreet aims to avoid introducing them in future OCaml code with a mode-extension to the type system](https://blog.janestreet.com/oxidizing-ocaml-parallelism/).

However, a number of data race alarms still remain. See https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11040.

[Ortac](https://github.com/ocaml-gospel/ortac) is a tool to extract runnable tests from Gospel specifications.

It provides interns with the opportunity for their first experience in open-source development. It is a central point for organising internships for groups of people historically facing systemic bias in the programming world.\n\nSince 2019 Tarides has been participating in this program by submitting [proposals](https://www.outreachy.org/apply/project-selection/#ocaml) and funding interns and mentors (working both at Tarides and outside of Tarides).\n\n\n## Goal of the proposal\n\nThe primary goal of our proposal is to enhance the reach, efficiency, and success of the [Outreachy program](https://www.outreachy.org/) within the OCaml community. Our proposed model of funding both interns and co-mentors has already demonstrated success, not only in facilitating the mentorship process but in retaining interns within the OCaml community after their Outreachy term has ended. We wish to expand this model, enabling more people at Tarides and the wider OCaml community to participate as mentors and co-mentors, ultimately creating a richer, more diverse, and inclusive OCaml community.\n\nFurther, we are dedicated to providing opportunities for individuals from underrepresented groups, which aligns with the core ethos of Outreachy. Our track record shows that our interns have grown tremendously with us, gaining valuable skills and knowledge that have paved the way for significant opportunities. For instance, Sonja Heinze, a former Outreachy intern, works full-time at Tarides on Jane Street commercial projects. We aim to continue fostering this growth, contributing to the OCaml community and the broader tech industry's diversity.\n\nBy funding more interns and co-mentors, we can expand the Outreachy program's reach, broaden the diversity of the OCaml community, and give people from underrepresented groups in tech a unique and impactful opportunity. The desired outcome is not only about contributing technically but also about nurturing a diverse community that is supportive, inclusive, and resilient. It is also a good way to experience [the biggest reasons newcomers give up on OCaml](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/what-are-the-biggest-reasons-newcomers-give-up-on-ocaml/10958) and drive the OCaml Platform UX improvements.\n\n\n## KR\n\n\n\n* 4-8 Outreachy interns are working on OCaml projects yearly (2-4 by cohorts, with 2 cohorts per year), both on projects submitted by Tarides and the wider OCaml community.\n* The results of the internship program are visible on ocaml.org, on watch.ocaml.org and on Discuss in the form of articles on each platform talking about the participants and their achievements/learning.\n* We keep track of where the interns are once their internship has ended. We follow up 6 months and 12 months after the program end. The goal of the follow-up is to track their career evolution and if they still use OCaml professionally or in their spare time.\n\n\n### Design\n\nN/A\n\n\n### Challenges\n\nOutreachy interns are very time-consuming to mentor. Especially there is the first phase, where many potential applicants are opening pull requests and asking questions. At the same time, it‚Äôs a good ‚Äúsocial experiment‚Äù to find UX pain points for OCaml beginners. Moreover, not all open-source projects are ready to accept applicants. It forces projects to think about onboarding ‚Äì which has a further reach than Outreachy. It‚Äôs probably a good idea to initially keep the list of Outreachy-ready projects quite focused (or at least as focused as we might have the capacity ‚Äì in terms of mentor availability ‚Äì  to supervise them).\n\n\n### Deliverables\n\n\n\n* We will publish bi-yearly updates on Discuss (similar to [this](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/outreachy-summer-2023/11159)) (to report on the 2 first KRs) where we mention Jane Street funding.\n* We will publish a yearly Outreachy blog post to report on the two last KRs. Updates are posted on [https://ocaml.org/outreachy](https://ocaml.org/outreachy)\n* Some publicity around Jane Street's funding of the internships\n* A report to JS as to who strong/interesting candidates might be\n* Advertising to the interns some of JS's programs.\n\n\n## Effort\n\n\n\n* The cost is $8k for an intern (fix Outreachy cost).\n* For mentors and co-mentors, we roughly estimated 0,5-1 day/week to mentor an intern. An internship lasts 3 months, the cost of mentoring is around 9 days per mentor (and co-mentor) per intern.\n* We also need to account for the costs of running the overall program (help mentors to scope projects, write and review proposals, help mentors and contributors, interact with partners and write reports). Currently it‚Äôs about a week of work (for a senior software engineer) per batch.\n\n\n## Priority\n\nMEDIUM\n\n\n### Why?\n\nDiversity is important to grow the OCaml community and raise awareness. It‚Äôs also a good way to bring people with many different experiences and backgrounds to our community, to make it more innovative and resilient.\n\n\n## Timeline\n\nWe have already doing this work since 2019.

While the first can comfortably be prototyped in OCaml with standard data structures and algorithms, the second kind is much harder as existing databases provide a very different memory model to organise the application state on persistent storage.\nTo achieve this goal, we aim to provide a minimal API which gives the illusion of a persistent, distributed memory heap of standard OCaml values while remaining efficient and correct. It will allow applications to save OCaml data on disks almost transparently and to program as if the database were in memory. For efficiency, we propose explicitly delimiting the serialisation units with a dedicated type and providing the corresponding functions to create such units and fetch them from storage.\nWe propose to store these units in a content-addressable key-value table: each piece of data is identified by its unique hash. This will enable caching and efficient communication of deltas over the network.\n\n```[tasklist]\n### Tasks\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/roadmap/issues/1073\n```\n","url":"https://github.com/tarides/objectives/issues/548","state":"OPEN"},{"title":"Irmin on Mirage","id":"I_kwDOG5OS8s53b-_v","number":549,"body":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pJ2YGKlDKc_IqHZxWgwHzASNaHyA8GdfFyJDy65pVko/edit#heading=h.izr6qe3mf0wt\nDuring the work on SpaceOS, it become apparent that the MirageOS environment could benefit a lot from having the support for a robust filesystem and a key-value store that would be able to handle huge entries.\n\nThis is why we have thought about Irmin, which provides a key-value store with support for various utilities such as history, data integrity, rollback.

2023","id":"I_kwDOG5OS8s588TGI","number":581,"body":"## Goal\r\nThe OCaml compiler, central to the OCaml ecosystem, requires continuous development and maintenance to address evolving needs and improve functionality. This proposal outlines a plan by Tarides engineers to contribute to the ongoing development of the OCaml compiler, focusing on areas of expertise such as multicore support, Windows compatibility, and build system enhancements. This initiative also aims to alleviate the maintenance[ bottleneck in the OCaml compiler development ](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/maintenance-bottlenecks-in-the-compiler-distribution/11045)and bring a range of improvements and fixes to the community.\r\n## KR\r\n1. Efficient triaging and review of issues and PRs in the [ocaml/ocaml](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml) repository (around 100 active PRs and issues per month, usually with a high level of complexity)\r\n2. A new version of the OCaml compiler is released every semester with significant contributions from Tarides engineers. \r\n3. Jane Street compiler engineers spend more time on ocaml-jst to develop new features, and their contributions to the OCaml compiler are reviewed efficiently.\r\n4. Compiler Hacking events take place to foster community involvement and the training of the next generation of OCaml compiler maintainers.\r\n## Design\r\nTarides focuses its maintenance efforts on areas where we have previously contributed or possess strong expertise, notably in multicore support, Windows compatibility, and build system improvements. Our engineering team skills range from expertise in the compiler front end (from contribution to the PPX and the type system) to runtime (from signal handling to the intricacies of the GC). Our work involves in-depth analysis and resolution of performance issues, especially in sequential programs running on OCaml 5, and a strong emphasis on enforcing the OCaml memory model for having both safety and reliable performance.\r\n\r\nWe are also maintaining the less glamorous bits of the compiler ‚Äì we incrementally enhance the compiler‚Äôs build system to reduce the complexity and portability of the compiler on various platforms, with a particular focus on improving the experience for Windows users. \r\n\r\nAlongside these technical endeavours, we are committed to fostering community engagement through organising Compiler Hacking events and contributing to the OCaml compiler newsletter. These initiatives are designed to facilitate open communication, share progress, and involve the community in the ongoing development of the OCaml compiler, thereby ensuring transparency and alignment with the community's needs.\r\n###  Challenges\r\nThe primary challenge is managing a diverse range of development needs with a strategically limited resource allocation while balancing with feature development. Our risk mitigation strategy is to allocate (and monitor) a relatively low % of maintenance time for all our developers (including the Junior developers) ‚Äì this allows us to spread the knowledge of the compiler more effectively and ensure our developers are mainly focused on developing new features.\r\n### Deliverables\r\n* A new version of the OCaml compiler is released every six months\r\n* We generate a quarterly report of all contributions made to the OCaml compiler, including pull requests created, issues reviewed, and specific areas of improvement or fixes.\r\n* We host at least three Compiler Hacking events in 2023 (in the UK, France and India) and summarise achievements, community feedback, and learning outcomes from these events (for instance, as a blog post or a post on Discuss).\r\n\r\n```[tasklist]\n### Tasks\n```","url":"https://github.com/tarides/objectives/issues/581","state":"CLOSED"},{"title":"Improving Syntax Error Messages for OCaml","id":"I_kwDOG5OS8s588UN-","number":582,"body":"```[tasklist]\n### Tasks\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/roadmap/issues/413\n```\n","url":"https://github.com/tarides/objectives/issues/582","state":"OPEN"},{"title":"CEOS","id":"I_kwDOG5OS8s588WII","number":583,"body":"```[tasklist]\n### Tasks\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/workitems/issues/1119\n```\n","url":"https://github.com/tarides/objectives/issues/583","state":"OPEN"},{"title":"General Dune Maintenance","id":"I_kwDOG5OS8s588YFK","number":584,"body":"```[tasklist]\n### Tasks\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/roadmap/issues/55\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/workitems/issues/1175\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/workitems/issues/1174\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/workitems/issues/1173\n```\n","url":"https://github.com/tarides/objectives/issues/584","state":"OPEN"},{"title":"General Merlin/OCaml-LSP Maintenance","id":"I_kwDOG5OS8s588b5a","number":585,"body":"```[tasklist]\n### Tasks\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/roadmap/issues/65\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/roadmap/issues/58\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/workitems/issues/57\n```\n","url":"https://github.com/tarides/objectives/issues/585","state":"OPEN"},{"title":"ORCHIDE","id":"I_kwDOG5OS8s59CGpD","number":586,"body":"Orchide is a 30 month long European project.

mirage and IoT projects","id":"I_kwDOG5OS8s5qv5uf","number":485,"body":"# Towards upstream support for building crossed OCaml compilers\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\n### Definitions\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, cross-compiling a program means building it on a\r\nplatform (called the build platform) which is different from the one on\r\nwhich it will run (the host platform). This way of compiling programs on\r\nan environemnt which is different from their execution environment has\r\nbecome widespread especially with smarphone apps which are generally not\r\ncompiled on the phone where they will run but rather on a computer whose\r\narchitecture and/or operating system is different from the phone's ones.\r\n\r\nFor a compiler, though, matters are a bit more complicated because\r\nthere are three platforms to consider rather than two: the build\r\nand host platforms as before, but also the target platform, which\r\nis the one on which the code generated by the compiler will itself be run.\r\n\r\nOne of the things that makes discussing cross-compilation in the context\r\nof OCaml difficult is that it implies considering the cross-compilation\r\nfor both programs (e.g. the OCaml runtime) and compilers (e.g. the\r\nOCaml native compilers). Also, one may have to reason with several\r\ndifferent build, host and target platforms depending on the part of the\r\nsystem one is talking about. For example, one will most likely want to\r\nrun the bootstrap compiler (boot/ocamlc) on the build platform in order\r\nto compile anything. For that, one will need a runtime system (ocamlrun)\r\nthat is built on the build platform and runs on the build platform, too. So\r\nfor this runtime, which is an ordinary C program, its build platform is\r\nthe global build platform but its host platform is the global build\r\nplatform too. Likewise, one may need two other runtime systmes: one that\r\nruns on the host platform where the compiler will be executed and\r\none that runs on the target platform, to be able to run the programs\r\ngenerated by the cross compiler. These two runtimes will have the\r\nsame build platform but for the first one the host platform will be\r\nthe compiler's host platform, whereas for the second one, its host\r\nplatform will be the compiler's target platform.\r\n\r\nOne other difficulty when discussing cross-compilation for OCaml is that\r\nthere are several objects to consider and it is important to be precise\r\nabout which object is considered. For instance, OCaml provides 4 compilers\r\nand discussing cross-compilation without being specific about which of\r\nthese compilers this involves does not really make sense.\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\nTo some extent, it can be said that OCaml already supports some\r\nforms of cross-compilation upstream, in two ways.\r\n\r\nFirst, regarding the bytecode compiler itself. The fact that bytecode is\r\nexecuted by a virtual machine (the runtime system) does not mean that\r\nthe three platforms introduced previously are not relevant. For such a\r\ncompiler, the build platform is the system on which it is built and the\r\nhost and target platfoms are, respectively, the runtime system on which\r\nthe compiler runs and the runtime system on which the produced code\r\nruns. These two runtime systems may be different and this difference\r\nmust be kept in mind and taken into account. In any case, when the two\r\nplatforms are different, it's a case of cross-compilation.\r\n\r\nSecond, as we have said before the so-called OCaml compiler actually\r\nconsists in not less than four compilers. Two of these foour compilers\r\nare actually cross-compilers: `ocamlc.opt` whose host platform is\r\nthe bytecode system and which produces native code and `ocamlopt.byte`\r\nwhose host platform is the chosen processor but which produces\r\nbytecode programs. The two other compilers are not crossed, because\r\n`ocamlc.byte` runs in bytecode and produces bytecode programs while\r\n`ocamlopt.opt` runs in native code for the chosen architecture and\r\nproduces native code for that same architecture.\r\n\r\nthe feature which is not supported yet upstream is the build of a\r\ncrossed version of `ocamlopt.opt`, that is, a compiler that would run\r\non one `real` architecture (not in bytecode) and produce code that could then\r\nbe executed on another native architecture. This does however not mean\r\nthat such compilers do not exist at all. They do actually exist but\r\ntheir build process has not been upstreamed yet, mostly because\r\nthe compiler in general and its build system in particular are not\r\ncurrently flexible enough to make such an upstreaming easy and\r\nstraightforward.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this roadmap is thus threefold:\r\n\r\n 1. Describe the preparatory stages that are required to make the OCaml\r\n    system ready to integrate cross-compilation smoothly.\r\n 2. Explore two possible approaches to cross-compilation.\r\n 3. List a few directions that could be investigated once the ability\r\n    to build cross-compilers has been upstreamed.\r\n\r\n## Preparatory stages\r\n\r\nSeveral projects already make it possible to build cross-compilers for OCaml:\r\n\r\nTODO: list at least a few projects here.\r\n\r\nRoughly speaking, these projects present themselves as a set of script and patches which are maintained outside of the OCaml codebase and which modify the codebase and run the necessary operaitons to obtaiin cross-compilers.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the fact that such projects already exist shows that it is technically possible to build cross-compilers starting from the OCaml codebase in its current state.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the way these projects exists (as a set of patches and scripts that live outside of the OCaml codebase) shows that the codebase, in its current state, does not naturally lend itself to the construction of cross-compilers, and not even to the upstreaming of the projects that go in this direction.\r\n\r\nWe are convinced that one major reason why the maintainers of the existing projects related to cross compilation did not even attempt to upstream their work is the state of the compiler's build system, which is scatered over several fragile and hard to maintain Makefiles. The work proposal described below is thus not strictly-speaking necessarily to the construction of cross-compiler, but we believe it is necessary if the aim is the upstreaming of such a production, especially if the aim is to obtain a system which is sustainable in the long run.\r\n\r\nBy making OCaml compiler's build system more parallel, more robust and more flexible, the work proposed below will not only offer a saner base for the upstreaming of cross-compilation, but it will also make a lot of other things easier, like measuring code coverage of the compiler by its testsuite, etc.\r\n\r\n### Merging all the makefiles\r\n\r\nCurrently, the compiler's build system consists of more than 40 makefiles.\r\nSome of them build the objects in their subdirectory, while others\r\nare included in the first ones to share code. Althouhg some form of code sharing does already exist, a lot of duplicaiton remains. For instance, the rules to compile OCaml modules, libraries and programs are repeated in all the makefiles, making the system very hard to maintain. Also, since OCaml is built by a root Makefile runnign sub-makefiles, no instance of make can have a complete view of the project's dependency graph. This does not only mean that the compiler's build may not be as parallel (thus fast) as it could, but it also means that the achieved degree of parallelism relies on developers being clever enough to order builds properly and is thus fragilen not mentioonning incremental builds and rebuilds which are not even used by core developers inspite of the time that it would save, because they are not considered reliable and are, in fact, broken most of the time.\r\n\r\nThere is thus work being done to merge all these makefiles into one. This work has started with pull requests #11243, #11248, #11268, #11420 and #11675 whichmeregd the makefiles of the lex, yacc, utils, tools and runtime subdirectories in to the root Makefile. Although this work is only at its beginning, it has already proved beneficial since it allowed to express build rules in a much more concise way and makes it easier to express dependencies in a more fine-grained way.\r\n\r\nThe aim here is to coontinue the merge until only one makefile remains and handle the build for the whole OCaml system.\r\n\r\n#### Breaking the dynlink-compilerlibs dependency\r\n\r\nCurrently, the dynlink library depends on compilerlibs. This not only means that dynlink needs to be linked to compilerlibs but, more problematically, that dynlink neeeds to embed *a copy* of compilerlibs. This makes building dynlink slow and makes the library big. We are thus working on making dynlink iindendent on compilerlibs, so that its build process can be simpliifed.\r\n\r\n### Improving ocamldep\r\n\r\nCurrently it is run on both source files and generated files. So it's\r\ndifficult for ocamldep to know what belongs to the source tree and what\r\nbelongs to the build tree. Hence the two following improvmenets:\r\n\r\n#### Accepting more input formats\r\n\r\nSo that ocamldep can be called only on source files, i.e. we must make\r\nit able to understand `.mll`, `.mly` and `.ml.in` files.\r\n\r\nAt this stage it should become possilbe to get rid of the `beforedepend`\r\ntargets of the build system that make sure the generated files\r\ncurrently required by `ocamldep` because of its inability to parse\r\nsource files have been produced before ocamldep is invoked.\r\n\r\n#### Specifying source and build tree\r\n\r\nThis has to do with the rules generated by ocamldep. Basically the idea\r\nis to add two options, `-source-tree` and `-build-tree` which will take\r\narguments ocamldep will use to prefix the rules it generates. These\r\nprefixes can be build variables, so that `make` can give them different\r\nvalues. Typical invocation:\r\n\r\n```\r\nocamldep -source-tree '$(SRCDIR)' -build-tree '$(OD)' driver/optmain.ml*\r\n```\r\n\r\nAssumign `driver/optmain.ml*` expands to `driver/optmain.ml` and\r\n`driver/optmain.mli` and the `Optmain` module has no other dependency\r\nthis is expected to produce rules like\r\n\r\n```\r\n$(OD)/driver/optmain.cmo: \\\r\n  $(SRCDIR)/driver/optmain.ml $(OD)/driver/optmain.cmi\r\n$(OD)/driver/optmain.cmi: $(SRCDIR)/driver/optmain.mli\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it becomes possible to build files several times just by using\r\ndifferent values of `OD` (for Output Directory) during the build.\r\n\r\n### Distinguishing build artefacts\r\n\r\nCurrently the files produced by `boot/ocamlc` and those produced by the\r\nnewly compiled `./ocamlc` go to the same build tree which is actually\r\nthe source tree. This requires a lot of precautions (cf. the\r\n`partialclean` target that needs to be used to make sure all the\r\nartefacts of the boot compiler have been removed before the new\r\ncompiler starts to produce its own ones) and even with these precautions\r\nit's possible to mess up while working on the compiler.\r\n\r\nSo the purpose of this step is, while keeping the source and the build\r\ntree at the same place, to make sure the files produced by `boot/ocamlc`\r\nare written under `boot/`. This should be easy to achieve just by using\r\n`OD=boot` (versus `OD=.` for files produced by `./ocamlc` in the\r\nrecursive invocations of make.\r\n\r\n### Simplifying the bootstrap procedure\r\n\r\nCurrently the build system is not flexible enough to make it possible\r\nto build `./ocamlc` from `boot/ocamlc` without debugging symbols. This\r\nmakes it harder than required to then verify that the newly built\r\ncompiler is identical to the boot compiler, because one has to\r\nstrip debugging symbols. If the aim is to verify that the bootstrap is\r\nat a fixpoint, it would be much more straightforward not to include\r\ndebugging symbols in the first place and this should become possible\r\n(and easy) at this stage, which should allow one to get rid of the\r\n`stripdebug` and `cmpbyt` bits during the bootstrap verification\r\nstage, which should boil down to simply comparing the two files byte-by-byte.\r\n\r\n### Making the build more parallel\r\n\r\nOnce the build system is gather in one Makefile and we have finer-grained control on where the build artifacts go, it should beocme possilbe to express dependencies that oculd not be expressed before and, thus, to make the build of OCaml more parallel and this parallelism itself more robust since it will be by construction.\r\n\r\n### Producing ocamlopt.opt more directly\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to produce ocamlopt from `boot/ocamlc` without\r\nproducing `./ocamlc` first. This would make it faster to produce\r\n`ocamlopt.opt` and one could imagine to have a configure option to\r\ndisable the bytecode compiler completely.\r\n\r\n### Compiling flambda / clambda only when required\r\n\r\nSo far, both clambda and flambda are compiled, no matter whether flambda has been enableed or not at configure time.\r\n\r\nWith a saner build system, we shold be in a much better position to compile only the backend that is actually required. This should result in smaller compielrs and in faster builds, with the additional benefit that it should be a good preparation for the upstreaming of FLambda2.\r\n\r\n### Supporting out-of-source-tree builds\r\n\r\nAt this stage the following thing shouldd have become a very\r\nlow-hanging fruit:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/tmp/build$ ~/src/ocaml/trunk/configure\r\n/tmp/build$ make\r\n/tmp/build$ make install\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith `~/src/ocaml/trunk` untouched.\r\n\r\n### Using an already installed compiler rather than `boot/ocamlc`\r\n\r\nThat's something else that should have become way easier to achieve at\r\nthis stage and is of interest to many people, especially (but not only)\r\nin the context of cross compilation. For instance the following should\r\nwork:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./configure --with-bootstrap-compiler=`which ocamlc`\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn that case, the compiler's build system shold notice that there already is an installed runtime and that it can hence build the new runtime in parallel with  the compiler, rather than having to build it before when the runtime is required to be able to run the boot compiler. In other words, in this scenario, the runtime is not a dependency for building the new compiler, as it is classically.\r\n\r\n## Cross-compilation itself\r\n\r\nPay attention to changes of word size between host and target.\r\n\r\nGoing from 64bits hosts to 32bits targets should already work, but\r\nthe reverse is not certain at all.\r\n\r\nThis is true no matter which of the following scenarios is chosen.\r\n\r\n### Scenario #1: relying on an already installed compiler\r\n\r\nThat's how people do cross-compilatin nowadays, hence the importance of\r\nthe previous step.\r\n\r\n### Scenario #2: from sources and only from sources\r\n\r\nThat's the hardest, most ambitious approach. One may wonder why one\r\nshould bother trying to do that whereas relying on an already installed\r\ncompiler seems easier. The question makes sense and in practice it may\r\nbe more direct to approach things that way. But the ability to do\r\nevderything from sources would in itself prove good and generic design.\r\nSomehow, being able to do everything from source would kind of proove\r\nthat we did things the right way, because such a thing could not work if\r\nwe did somethiing the wrong way.\r\n\r\n## A few post cross-compilation directions to explore\r\n\r\n### Merging ocamlc and ocamlopt\r\n\r\nthe purpose would be to have only one compiler, ocamlc, for both\r\nbytecode and native code.\r\n\r\n### Multi-backend compiler\r\n\r\nThe idea here is to be able to embed several (native) backends in the same compiler at configure time, so that any of them can then be selected at runtime.\r\n\r\n### The compiler as a library\r\n\r\nThis is to make it possible for a build systme like Dune to compile several files without having to fork.\r\n\r\nAs for the previous items, being able to do that means that the compiler has no global state, which would mean that it has become itself very functional.\r\n\r\n### Smartphone applicaiton developemnt support\r\n\r\nthis means finding ways to access the native toolkits frm OCaml so that it becomes possible to write complete applications in OCaml without having to use the platform-specific languages (Java for Android, Swift for iOS).\r\n\r\n```[tasklist]\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/roadmap/issues/443\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/roadmap/issues/1064\n```\r\n","url":"https://github.com/tarides/objectives/issues/485","state":"OPEN"},{"title":"OCaml LSP supports every LSP request","id":"I_kwDOG5OS8s5qwiem","number":488,"body":"```[tasklist]\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/roadmap/issues/240\n```\n","url":"https://github.com/tarides/objectives/issues/488","state":"CLOSED"},{"title":"Prototype JSOO with effects to enable use of OCaml features and libraries","id":"I_kwDOG5OS8s5qwigu","number":490,"body":"```[tasklist]\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/roadmap/issues/474\n```\n","url":"https://github.com/tarides/objectives/issues/490","state":"CLOSED"},{"title":"Ensure OCaml 5 series has feature parity with OCaml 4 (Community)","id":"I_kwDOG5OS8s5qwihv","number":491,"body":"## Goal\r\nOCaml 5 introduced effect handlers and parallelism to the language.

These tests should also pass. \r\n## Design\r\nAs with the rest of the multicore development effort, we will develop the work with the following guiding principles:\r\n\r\nFirst get the features working under sequential execution with as little breakages as possible.\r\nEnsure that the sequential performance of these features are in the same ballpark as OCaml 4.\r\nDefine the intended semantics for parallel execution.\r\nImplement support for these features under parallelism.\r\n### Unloadable runtime\r\n[Unloadable runtime](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/71) is a feature that performs proper resource cleanup when OCaml is used as a shared library. In particular, when a host program written in a different language uses OCaml as a library and the control returns back to the host program, unloadable runtime feature ensure a proper cleanup of the OCaml resources including the stack, heap sections, code fragments, custom operations, various buffers and tables. \r\n\r\nThis feature was left unimplemented when multicore OCaml was upstreamed. There are users in the community who would [like to have this feature restored](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10865#issuecomment-1559741460). The plan is to restore this feature and make it work in the context of multi-domain programs. \r\n\r\nAs a first step, we will implement an unloadable runtime that works correctly with a program that does not spawn additional domains. This restores the feature with respect to what was possible in OCaml 4. \r\n\r\nThe next step is to ensure that resources are properly cleaned up in a multi-domain program. The challenge here is that when the main domain returns to its caller, there might still be other domains that are executing OCaml code. In general, an OCaml program exits when the main domain runs to completion. We can adopt the same behaviour when OCaml is loaded as a shared library ‚Äì when the main domain returns, all the other domains are brought to a stop and terminated. The runtime currently does not have a logic for terminating all of the running domains (only stopping them for a GC is supported). There is also the suggestion from OCaml maintainers that all the domains spawned must be joined before unloading the runtime, which might also be acceptable as it mirrors the expectation from a program with multiple threads in OCaml 4. Support for multi-domain unloadable runtime will require some design discussions with OCaml maintainers.\r\n### MSVC\r\nOCaml supports compilation to Windows through 3 separate tool chains ‚Äì cygwin, mingw and MSVC. Out of these, cygwin and mingw support has been restored in OCaml 5. However, the native C compiler from Microsoft MSVC cannot be used to build OCaml 5 for Windows. This support was available in OCaml 4. The task here is to restore support for this.\r\n\r\nThere is an experimental prototype for MSVC support which has been proposed in [this PR](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/11835). The PR also lists a number of sub tasks that need to be completed to upstream this work. We will complete and upstream the dependencies as well as the main support for MSVC.\r\n\r\nOne of the blockers for multicore support for this work is the fact that MSVC did not support C11 atomics, which are used in the OCaml runtime. C11 atomics are now supported in [Visual Studio 2022](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/c11-atomics-in-visual-studio-2022-version-17-5-preview-2/) but the support is experimental and bugs have been found in the implementation of C11 atomics. Given the fact that MSVC C11 atomics are implemented but buggy, our plan is to ensure that all the sequential tests pass and identify places where the parallel tests fail due to bugs in MSVC. For the latter, we shall make issues on the Github OCaml issue tracker and report these bugs to Microsoft.\r\n\r\n```[tasklist]\r\n## Work Items\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/roadmap/issues/403\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/roadmap/issues/1063\r\n```\r\n","url":"https://github.com/tarides/objectives/issues/491","state":"OPEN"},{"title":"Consistent stories and tools for testing and verifying OCaml 5 applications","id":"I_kwDOG5OS8s5qwi53","number":494,"body":"```[tasklist]\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/roadmap/issues/424\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/roadmap/issues/425\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/roadmap/issues/426\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/roadmap/issues/438\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/roadmap/issues/464\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/roadmap/issues/472\r\n```\r\n","url":"https://github.com/tarides/objectives/issues/494","state":"CLOSED"},{"title":"Release OCaml 5.00","id":"I_kwDOG5OS8s5qwjQv","number":495,"body":"```[tasklist]\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/roadmap/issues/494\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/roadmap/issues/555\n```\n","url":"https://github.com/tarides/objectives/issues/495","state":"CLOSED"},{"title":"Tarides.com deployment","id":"I_kwDOG5OS8s5qwjSi","number":497,"body":"","url":"https://github.com/tarides/objectives/issues/497","state":"OPEN"},{"title":"Tarides Internships","id":"I_kwDOG5OS8s5qwjU_","number":499,"body":"```[tasklist]\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/roadmap/issues/436\n```\n","url":"https://github.com/tarides/objectives/issues/499","state":"CLOSED"},{"title":"OCaml.org is the Best Resource to Learn OCaml","id":"I_kwDOG5OS8s5qw3Yf","number":505,"body":"","url":"https://github.com/tarides/objectives/issues/505","state":"OPEN"},{"title":"Develop and integrate domainslib/eio/lockfree","id":"I_kwDOG5OS8s5qw3ca","number":507,"body":"","url":"https://github.com/tarides/objectives/issues/507","state":"OPEN"},{"title":"Establish a Roadmap for the OCaml Platform","id":"I_kwDOG5OS8s5rPAPs","number":523,"body":"**Why**\nThe establishment of a community-driven roadmap for the OCaml Platform is essential for prioritizing work that users care most about and promoting transparency in the platform's development, encouraging community participation.\n\n**Key Results:**\n\n- [ ] 80% of community satisfaction on the OCaml Platform roadmap.\n\n- [ ] OCaml Platform roadmap has been adopted and is featured on OCaml.org.\n\n\n\n```[tasklist]\n### Tasks\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/roadmap/issues/89\n```\n","url":"https://github.com/tarides/objectives/issues/523","state":"CLOSED"},{"title":"Define Metrics","id":"I_kwDOG5OS8s5fE2yu","number":31,"body":"We should define proper metrics and associated KPIs for all the strategic objectives.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is that we mostly need to figure out what number to pick initially.

It represents the best way for beginners and experienced developers to write, build, document and publish software in OCaml. The OCaml Platform is the scaffolding and the tooling around the core compiler to make it usable for day-to-day work. Since OCaml 4.11, the OCaml Platform tools have been released in sync with the OCaml compiler.\n\nOver 25 years, a collection of tools has addressed successive UX gaps for OCaml development. Each of these tools did start with an original mandate and progressively evolved. In 2022, the OCaml Platform comprises many tools - while each of them taken individually often does a great job, some overlap and work differently than others. Unfortunately, the resulting overall developer experience is suboptimal because of this.\n\nOver the next three years, we want to rectify the situation and offer feature parity with tooling ecosystems such as Go or Rust. The primary focus is to build a seamless IDE experience and a thriving community of open-source projects around the Platform.\n\nHere is a list of potential projects to achieve our goal:\n\n- OCaml users have access to great tools to reach features and UX parity with Rust/Cargo;\n- The development roadmap of the OCaml roadmap is agreed upon and communicated within the community;\n- The governance of the OCaml Platform is defined and used to make the definition of the platform tools evolve;\n- User personas for the platform are defined, and we start to get qualitative and quantitative feedback from those to drive the development of the platform;\n- More companies are using OCaml as onboarding new developers in their projects is becoming easier.\n\nSome examples of specific metrics for success are:\n\n- How well do we know the OCaml Platform users? UX/UI pain points are categorised via user archetypes; that categorisation drives the platform's product-oriented evolution. How many users do we have? Are they happy with the tools we provide?\n- How more productive are OCaml Platform users? We can quantify the time it takes to set up a project, debug an issue, discover libraries to solve a given problem, etc.\n- How resilient is the OCaml Platform? How many external maintainers (not working at Tarides) do we have? How many are paid to work on the Platform as part of their main job? Will the Platform continue to develop if Tarides works on something different? Is there a separate entity funded to keep that work going?\n\n\n```[tasklist]\n### Operational Objectives\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/goals/issues/71\n```\n```[tasklist]\n### Q1 2024 Objectives\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/goals/issues/600\n```\n","url":"https://github.com/tarides/objectives/issues/32","state":"OPEN"},{"title":"The OCaml language continues to evolve","id":"I_kwDOG5OS8s5fE--2","number":33,"body":"> OCaml matches Rust's performance and Python‚Äôs expressivity.\n\nOCaml 5 brings two significant changes to the OCaml ecosystem: multicore and effects.\n\nWith multicore, OCaml programs will go fast. Performance is still the main criterion when picking a software stack (vs security/safety). Some mainstream languages are not very performant (i.e. Python), but performance is essential to attract experienced systems and low-level programmers used to developing in C, C++, Go or Rust.\n\nWith effect handlers, OCaml programs will be simpler; developers can write simple direct-style code while getting portable and performant applications. Direct-style code is straightforward to read and write; it‚Äôs already a style appealing to students who learn OCaml around the globe, but power/commercial users do not use it because it has performance implications. Effects have a significant potential to remove the split between beginner and expert users and reduce the learning curve to be productive in the language.\n\nMulticore and effects are thus a significant innovation that will bring a lot of visibility to OCaml and, consequently, to Tarides.  But\nthe work is not done yet. Tarides is dedicated to advancing the OCaml programming language and ensuring it remains at the forefront of the functional programming community. By evolving OCaml, we can increase its adoption and recognition among developers and businesses and further its position as a leading choice for building high-performance, reliable, and secure systems.\n\nWe will focus on bringing innovative features to OCaml, such as support for WebAssembly (Wasm), enabling OCaml developers to build web applications and other high-level abstractions that are portable across different platforms. We will also develop reliable testing and benchmarking tools to support the growth of the OCaml ecosystem and ensure that OCaml applications are robust and performant.\n\nIn addition, we will prioritise maintaining the quality and stability of the OCaml compiler, driving its evolution to keep pace with\nindustry developments and the latest advances in functional programming. This will ensure that OCaml remains a competitive and relevant choice for developers and businesses. We will also collaborate with partners such as Inria and Jane Street to stay ahead of the curve and leverage their expertise and experience to drive the growth and success of OCaml.\n\nTo measure the success of these efforts, we can use the following metrics:\n\n- Number of compiler features that we helped to upstream from commercial requests: This metric will track the number of new features or improvements we helped bring to the OCaml compiler, either through our efforts or by collaborating with other partners such as Jane Street. By increasing the number of features and capabilities available in OCaml, we can make it a more attractive and competitive choice for developers and businesses.\n- Higher revenue from existing commercial contracts: As we help evolve OCaml and increase its capabilities, we can expect increased interest and adoption from our existing commercial clients. This metric will track any increases in revenue from these contracts, providing a measure of the success of our efforts to support and grow the OCaml ecosystem.\n- Number of new customers: As OCaml becomes more widely recognised and adopted, we can expect to see an increase in the number of new customers interested in using it for their projects. This metric will track the growth in the number of new customers that we acquire, providing a measure of the success of our efforts to promote OCaml and build a thriving ecosystem around it.\n- Time between OCaml and platform releases: To ensure that OCaml remains a cutting-edge language, it is important to regularly release new versions and updates incorporating the latest features and improvements. This metric will track the time between releases of the OCaml compiler and other platform components, providing a measure of our ability to keep pace with the latest developments in the functional programming community.\n- Number of packages that might break with new releases: As we release new versions of the OCaml compiler and other platform components, it is important to ensure that these releases do not break existing applications or libraries. This metric will track the number of packages that might be affected by new releases, providing a measure of the stability and compatibility of OCaml.\n- Test coverage without regressions: To ensure the quality and reliability of OCaml, comprehensive testing and benchmarking tools must be used to verify the correctness and performance of OCaml applications.\n\n```[tasklist]\n### Q1 2024 Objectives\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/goals/issues/601\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/goals/issues/602\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/goals/issues/604\n```\n","url":"https://github.com/tarides/objectives/issues/33","state":"OPEN"},{"title":"The OCaml ecosystem is aligned with Tarides' business focus","id":"I_kwDOG5OS8s5fE_nP","number":34,"body":"> OCaml provides the appropriate libraries for computing, storage, and networking tasks to get started with secure IoT projects\n\nTo build useful applications, it is important to provide OCaml developers and Tarides customers with a set of components tailored to their specific business needs. This can include libraries for IoT applications and tools for mission-critical systems, such as formally verified standard libraries and model checkers. By providing these components, Tarides can help its customers build solutions that meet their respective domains' standards, compliances, and best practices.\n\nEcosystem libraries can be categorised into four main categories: compute, network, storage and UX/UI elements. To build an application, users must choose the technology stack they want to use for each element. For example, a firewall appliance written in OCaml will need a secure runtime (provided by MirageOS's cross-compiler), an efficient network stack that can scale to multiple cores (using eio), an auditable, distributed storage to store configuration values (using Irmin) and a web frontend (using Dream). For each business vertical that Tarides chooses to focus on, we must understand, design, implement, and document the ideal technology stack.\n\nOur ecosystem focus is driven by community and business needs. The main priority in 2023 for Tarides is the development of secure IoT/Edge devices, which include resource-constrained satellites from nano to Cube to Micro Sats. They all need a secure runtime environment and an efficient I/O stack.\n\nTo achieve these goals, Tarides can focus on the following projects:\n\n- Develop a modern multicore-capable IO stack (eio) for OCaml\n- Enhance the security of OCaml runtime environments\n- Implement support for auditable, distributed storage for OCaml data\n- Improve the interoperability of OCaml with other languages\n- Develop libraries and tools with a potential impact on the OCaml community, such as:\n  - Standard libraries that are formally verified\n  - Model checkers for OCaml code\n  - Extracted code using F* and Coq\n- Promote the use of OCaml for building web services and other high-performance applications\n- Create support libraries and tools with a potential impact on businesses, such as:\n  - Libraries and tools specific to the IoT/Edge device market\n  - Libraries and tools for IO-intensive applications\n  - Libraries and tools for other business verticals, such as\n    healthcare, finance, etc.\n\nTo measure the success of these projects, we can use the following metrics:\n\n- Number of customers/leads for a given vertical\n- Adoption of OCaml by IoT/Edge device manufacturers\n- Number of applications built using the OCaml technology stack\n- Usage of OCaml in web services and other high-performance applications\n- Impact on the OCaml community and ecosystem.\n```[tasklist]\n### Q1 2024 Objectives\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/goals/issues/590\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/goals/issues/591\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/goals/issues/592\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/goals/issues/594\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/goals/issues/595\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/goals/issues/596\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/goals/issues/597\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/goals/issues/598\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/goals/issues/599\n```\n","url":"https://github.com/tarides/objectives/issues/34","state":"OPEN"},{"title":"The OCaml community has a sustainable governance and funding model","id":"I_kwDOG5OS8s5fFCJ6","number":35,"body":"> The OCaml community has a sustainable governance and funding model and that model that doesn‚Äôt rely solely on Tarides and Jane Street.\n\nWe use and develop open-source software, one of the most efficient and effective ways to distribute software to users and ensure long-term stability.

This is especially important in open-source, where the [existing gender bias and imbalance are well-known and profound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_in_open-source_software).\n\nOpen-source communities have many different kinds of users. Many volunteers are happy and able to work on feature development, gleaming and exciting ones. This includes both small bug fixes and larger features. Some people are also paid to work on OCaml, mostly at large companies. While both groups have good intentions, their motivations and incentives are different: the first group is motivated by fun and learning opportunities, while the second group is motivated by what is good for their employers.\n\nTarides's contributions to the community are different: we want to do things that are primarily good for OCaml's sustainability and growth, which usually involve ‚Äúboring‚Äù tasks that no one else wants to do. We also want to be transparent about our work to encourage external\nengagement.\n\nOur metrics focus on upstream/downstream relationships, i.e., the people/entities we are working with and bringing with us on our journey, including:\n\n- Downstream: how well do we know our users?

For example, having a diverse workforce can help to reduce risk and enhance a company's reputation. In addition, diverse teams are often more innovative and creative than homogenous teams, which can give a company a competitive advantage.\n\nTo achieve these goals, we will focus on several key initiatives. For instance, we will support the adoption of OCaml by providing resources and training for learners of all levels and backgrounds. We will also establish a thriving internship program at Tarides to provide interns with technical onboarding and mentorship opportunities. We also would like to understand how various groups of people come to learn OCaml, and we will optimise the corresponding adoption pathways for diverse groups of users. Finally, we will establish a diversity and inclusion task force at Tarides to ensure we actively work towards a more diverse and inclusive workplace.\n\nThrough these efforts, we can make significant progress in increasing diversity within the OCaml community and at Tarides and create a more innovative and inclusive environment where everyone can thrive.\n\nTo measure the success of our efforts to increase diversity within the OCaml community and at Tarides, we will use the following metrics:\n\n- Number of people being paid to write OCaml - This metric can help us understand the extent to which OCaml is being adopted in the industry and whether our efforts to support its use are having a positive impact.\n- Availability of resources and training specifically for different types of interns - Providing specific resources and training can help us support a broader range of learners and ensure our internship program is accessible and inclusive.\n- Existence of a code of conduct for the OCaml community and Tarides projects - A code of conduct can help establish clear guidelines for behaviour within the OCaml community, promoting a safe and welcoming environment for all members.\n- Number of people using non-standard pathways to learn and teach OCaml - Tracking the number of people using non-standard pathways to learn and teach OCaml can help us understand the effectiveness of our efforts to support alternative learning methods to expand the reach of OCaml education.\n- Evaluation of existing adoption pathways and identification of potential optimisations - It can help us improve the user experience for those learning and using OCaml, making it easier and more accessible for a broader range of individuals and organisations.\n- Creation of an OCaml job board beyond Tarides - An OCaml job board can help connect OCaml developers with potential employers, increasing the visibility and availability of job opportunities in the OCaml community.\n- Establishment of a roadmap and budget for diversity and inclusion initiatives - Developing a roadmap and budget for diversity and inclusion initiatives can help ensure that we progress towards our goals and have the resources and support necessary to achieve them.\n- Positive press and associations for Tarides and the OCaml community related to diversity and inclusion efforts - Positive press and associations can help raise awareness of our efforts to increase diversity and inclusion within the OCaml community and help promote a positive image for Tarides and OCaml as a whole.\n```[tasklist]\n### Q1 2024 Objectives\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/goals/issues/608\n```\n","url":"https://github.com/tarides/objectives/issues/36","state":"OPEN"},{"title":"The OCaml community has a successful outreach","id":"I_kwDOG5OS8s5fFDfj","number":37,"body":"> The OCaml community has a successful outreach, integrating and leveraging other successful ecosystems.\n\nTo have a successful outreach, we must ensure that the OCaml community is well-connected with other thriving programming language communities.

This will have a direct commercial impact on Tarides‚Äô clients, who can apply multicore support to many use cases and so reap immediate benefits. For example, Tezos is already enjoying the benefits of parallel execution in their plonk prover, and Tarides has been funded to bring parallelism to Octez. Jane Street has also been a long-time supporter of multicore OCaml efforts, and they have recently expressed interest in using multicore internally for a \"complex project\". This opens up new business development opportunities for Tarides, such as bringing in more projects from these existing partners.\n\nIn the wider functional programming ecosystem, first-class multicore support on Arm64 will give OCaml a competitive advantage over GHC Haskell (which, for many, is a language quite similar to OCaml, with many similar use cases). This, combined with OCaml's ability to exploit cheap parallel hardware in the cloud, such as the AWS Graviton3, makes OCaml a more attractive choice for businesses looking for performant and scalable solutions. OCaml is also the first industrial-strength language with support for effect handlers. This allows for composable and modular non-local control flow mechanisms, simplifying concurrent programming compared to other languages. This can provide a competitive edge for businesses that want to take advantage of the benefits of functional programming without the complexity of other languages.\n\nOur work has a clear commercial impact and will create value for our customers and partners. We participate in and lead commercial projects with significant, positive, measurable impacts on our community, industry, and society. We also value solid and trusted long-term collaborations to mature the OCaml and Tarides industry presence.\n\nTo measure the commercial impact and business development opportunities of OCaml 5.00 and the broader OCaml ecosystem, we can use the following metrics:\n\n- *Number of contracts signed with new and existing clients:* This metric will indicate the number of businesses adopting OCaml and entering into contracts with Tarides to use OCaml for their projects. This can include contracts for development, support, training, and other OCaml-related services.\n- *Revenue generated from new and existing clients:* This metric will indicate the financial value of the contracts signed with new and existing clients. This will help measure OCaml's overall value to businesses and Tarides.\n- *Number of new business development opportunities:* This metric will indicate the potential for growth and expansion of the OCaml ecosystem. This can include new partnerships, collaborations, and other opportunities for OCaml to be used in new areas and industries.\n- *Number of documented use cases:* This metric will indicate the number of documented examples of how OCaml has been used successfully by businesses and organisations. These use cases can serve as a reference for potential clients and partners and help demonstrate the benefits of OCaml in various contexts.\n- *Sales pipeline:* This metric will indicate the number and value of potential sales opportunities in the pipeline. This can include the number of leads, the stage of the sales process, and the estimated value of each opportunity.

We highlight the three most important improvements below:\n\n\n\n* Simplified installation as a result of having a single CLI tool to manage projects\n* More integrated editor experience. Users can edit their dune projects to install dependencies and never have to leave their editors.\n* Easier testing in different environments, including compiler versions.\n\n\n### Simplified installation\n\nAt present, if a user would like to set up an OCaml development environment to work on a GitHub project ocaml/foo, they need to perform the following steps:\n\nBy positioning Dune as the only tool needed to manage dependencies and build projects, we aim to simplify the installation process to:\n\nWhich would allow users to go from a clean environment to running an executable in just a few commands:\n\n\n### Manage build from the editor\n\nWith Dune support for package management, we can extend the scope of existing Dune features. This is especially interesting for Dune‚Äôs watch mode, which will now not only re-build the project‚Äôs code, but also monitor changes on the project‚Äôs dependencies and update them as needed.\n\nIn practice, this means that with Dune watch mode, users will never need to resort to using the command line to build their projects: they can make changes to dune-project and the new dependencies will be downloaded, and the project rebuilt automatically.\n\nConcretely, consider the current workflow to build a project, make changes on the editor, update a dependency, and re-build the project:\n\nSo you need to interrupt your workflow in a quite disruptive way: you have to stop Dune‚Äôs watch mode, and leave your editor to use the command line to run the necessary opam commands, wait for them to complete to resume your work.\n\nNow consider the same task with Dune 4:\n\nThere is no workflow interruption anymore, you ran dune build -w once, and can perform every updates on your project, including updating your dependencies, from the editor.\n\n\n### Test in different environments\n\nDune being in control of the environment configuration makes it trivial to build and test with different configurations. For instance consider the current workflow to run tests on different compiler versions:\n\n\n\n* Create a dune-workspace files\n* Create the opam switches\n* Run tests with `dune test --workspace dune-workspace`\n\nWhen Dune supports package management, you can remove step 2. entirely, as Dune will be managing the different contexts under the hood. Running tests on different compilers is resumed to:\n\n\n\n* Create a dune-workspace files\n* Run `dune test --workspace dune-workspace`\n\nAnd this is not limited to the compiler version. Every configuration, such as optional dependencies, can be added as a context and Dune allows you to test using this configuration just as easily.\n\n\n### KR\n\n\n\n* The number of steps to compile an OCaml project from a clean environment is reduced to two (2) (compared to 7 currently using opam and dune).\n* Users can update the dependencies of their Dune projects without leaving the editor.\n\n\n## Design\n\nThe design and feature set is outlined in this [RFC](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/7680).\n\n\n### Alternatives\n\nAn important context for the project is that it offers a solution to the OCaml Platform roadmap goal of unifying the OCaml developer workflows under a single tool.\n\nWith this context, below are some alternatives to the proposal of integrating package management into Dune.\n\n\n#### Build System in Opam\n\nOne alternative approach is to absorb Dune into Opam, making it the overarching tool for the OCaml Platform. However, Dune currently integrates with other Platform tools like odoc, ocamlformat, merlin, utop, mdx, and more, something that Opam does not currently do. While such an integration is theoretically possible, it would require significantly more development effort and would duplicate existing functionalities already offered by Dune.\n\n\n#### Improve Opam and Dune Interaction\n\nImproving the interaction between Opam and Dune is another alternative to consider.\n\nWhile it's a worthy endeavour in itself, it would not directly solve the issue of having a unified frontend for the Platform (a core goal of the Platform roadmap).\n\nIt would also not help us to align community workflows with the ones used at Jane Street. Instead, it would bring them further apart, making it even harder to have a shared Editor infrastructure between the community and Jane Street.\n\n\n#### Creation of a New Tool\n\nThe creation of a new tool, which could act as a wrapper around both Opam and Dune, is another alternative. In fact, we would like to explore this option in the future.\n\nWe've discussed the idea of extracting project configuration and rules from Dune to make it a pure build system. This fits with the Platform design as a collection of independent tools that address specific development workflows.\n\nThe development of such a tool was proposed multiple times throughout the years by Anil Madhavapeddy and the Platform team as a potential direction for the Platform.\n\nIn OCaml 5, [we freed the ocaml command line](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/11253), with the idea that it could be recycled for such a tool in the future.\n\nHowever, seeing that project configuration and Platform tools integrations are already part of Dune, we'd like to keep the creation of a new tool out of scope for now and revisit the idea of extracting features unrelated to Build System from Dune at a later stage.\n\n### Work Items\n\n```[tasklist]\n### Work Items\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/roadmap/issues/84\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/roadmap/issues/1068\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/roadmap/issues/1069\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/roadmap/issues/1070\n```\n### Challenges\n\n\n\n* Integrating with opam and upstreaming changes: Opam is a large code base that wasn‚Äôt designed to be used as a library. To mitigate this challenge, we‚Äôre planning on making changes to opam in a fork of the project and upstream the changes when we‚Äôre confident that the APIs we added are stable enough for Dune‚Äôs package management needs. We are also working closely with the Opam maintenance team, with whom we‚Äôve agreed on the plans for the Opam and Dune integration.\n* Scoping for the initial version: while we want the initial version to be as complete as possible in terms of features, we don‚Äôt want to develop in an ivory tower and aim to release a first version of Dune package management as soon as it is viable. We expect to have to push back on feature requests from the community throughout the development.\n* Resources for code reviews: some changes will require time from Dune maintainers outside of Tarides. In particular, changes to the engine will have to be vetted by Jane Street‚Äôs Build System team, which may present a challenge if the maintainers don‚Äôt have enough time. To mitigate this, and related to the item above, we plan to be flexible in the scope of features for an initial release and scope work blocked by reviews for later versions.\n* Compatibility with existing projects: Dune will have to support every opam feature used by packages on opam-repository. This might be challenging for some features. For example, some opam constraints supported by opam‚Äôs solver might not be compatible with 0install solver. We will make sure that we test Dune 4 extensively on all the packages of the opam repository and eventually patch the opam repository to make it easier for Dune to support opam package metadata.\n\n\n### Deliverables\n\nAs a main deliverable and outcome of this proposal, users will be able to use the development version of Dune to generate a lock directory and build both [ocaml/ocaml.org](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org) and [janestreet/bonsai](https://github.com/janestreet/bonsai) (used as test repositories for the MVP).\n\nThe end-to-end workflow is the following:\n\nTo achieve this, the following components will be implemented in Dune‚Äôs development branch:\n\n\n\n* Lock Directory Generation\n    * Development of the `dune lock` command to generate a lock directory.\n    * Development of new Dune actions to support the full array of opam features.\n* Source Fetching\n    * Development of Dune actions to facilitate fetching sources either remotely or from a local file system.\n* Execution of Lock Directory Build Plans\n    * Implementation of the the logic needed to execute a build plan originating from a lock directory and making build artifacts available in the current workspace.\n* Dune Context\n    * Addition of new fields to the Dune context to control the solver environment more effectively.\n* Caching\n    * Implement changes in the Dune cache to facilitate the caching of build steps derived from the lock directory.\n* Multiple Opam-repositories\n    * Develop functionalities in Dune context and lock file generation to facilitate the usage of multiple opam repositories.\n\nIn addition to the above features, users should be able to run the following commands on \n\n\n## Effort\n\n2.3 FTE for 12 months.\n\n\n\n* 0.7 Principal Software Engineer * 52 weeks (Rudi)\n* 0.8 Senior Software Engineer * 52 weeks (Stephen)\n* 0.8 Senior Software Engineer * 52 weeks (Marek)\n\n\n## Priority\n\nHIGH\n\n\n### Why?\n\nPackage Management in Dune is the single most impactful user experience improvement for OCaml developers. It will reduce the barriers to adoption drastically; bring Windows support for the OCaml Platform to parity with other operating systems; make cross-compilation usable in large-scale projects without relying on opam-monorepo and opam repositories overlays; make testing on different compilers and configurations effortless.\n\nIt will also bridge the gap between the community and Jane Street by aligning the community developer workflows to the ones used at Jane Street. In turn, this will allow Jane Street to benefit from the development of more community projects, like OCaml LSP and the VSCode extension.\n\n\n## Timeline\n\nWork started in Q2 2023 and is estimated to conclude in Q1 2024.\n\n## Point of contact\n\nN/A\n\n## Bucket\n\nCommunity\n\n## Slack channel\n\n[https://ocamllabs.slack.com/archives/C05AJGKLAJ3](https://ocamllabs.slack.com/archives/C05AJGKLAJ3)\n\n\n## Approvals\n\n\n* Yaron Minsky (yminsky@gmail.com) ‚Äì Approved\n* Andrey Mokhov (amokhov@janestreet.com) ‚Äì Approved\n","url":"https://github.com/tarides/objectives/issues/58","state":"OPEN"},{"title":"Merlin Performance Scales to Jane Street Codebase","id":"I_kwDOG5OS8s5iXqpT","number":59,"body":"**Why**\r\n\r\n_Why is this objective important_\r\n\r\nMerlin's performance in large code bases can be improved, in particular, users at Jane Street have reported that some queries can cause the editor to get frozen, or have to wait seconds for specific query results.

This is a serious barrier to OCaml adoption.\n\nBelow, we list properties of the OCaml.org learn area we wish to be true, and that we intend to realise with this proposal:\n\n\n\n1. Newcomers are able to get started with OCaml using OCaml.org (to the point that they have configured their editors, and are able to autonomously write simple OCaml programs, such as Advent of Code).\n2. OCaml users receive practical-minded guidance on how to work with opam and Dune, so that they can start their own OCaml projects.\n3. OCaml users are able to learn new intermediate and advanced topics (such as polymorphic variants, GADTs, custom let bindings & monads, effects, publishing opam packages) on OCaml.org.\n4. Readers can quickly find high-quality external learning resources for specific needs from OCaml.org.\n\nThere is broadly two things we aim to improve to achieve these objectives:\n\n\n\n* **The quantity and quality of available documentation.** For instance we don't have beginners documentation on Functions and Values, and we're lacking coverage on a lot of topics, such as GADTs. Some of the existing documents lack clarity or focus.\n* **The User Experience of the Learn Area.** The learning journey is not properly mapped, and the interface is suboptimal for users to quickly find the resource (either on OCaml.org or external) they are looking for.\n\n\n### KR\n\n\n\n* Newcomers can start writing simple programs twice as fast.\n* 80% of community users report being satisfied with the new OCaml.org Learn Area\n\n\n### How to measure this KR\n\n\n\n* We will organise focus groups to measure the time it takes to get up and running and write a simple program before and after.\n* We will run a community survey to measure the level of satisfaction with the new documentation\n\n\n## Design\n\n\n**User research**\n\nThe OCaml.org team follows a user-centric approach for all its development. This project follows a similar approach. We will run a community survey and conduct user interviews to understand users‚Äô biggest pain points.\n\nThe result of the user research will be used for both the creation of the new design, and the outline of the new documentation.\n\n_Note: user research has been completed in Q2 2023. We posted the result [on Discuss](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/you-started-to-learn-ocaml-less-than-12-months-ago-please-help-us-with-our-user-survey-on-the-ocaml-org-learning-area/11945/2)._\n\n\n**Design**\n\nBased on the result of the user research, we will create wireframes that we will validate both internally and with the community. We will then created high-fidelity designs for the landing pages and all of the pages under the Learn area. These will be similarly reviewed with the community and implemented iteratively.\n\n_Note: wireframes and designs have started in Q2 2023. They are available on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/bL31M0WWTTdu2z9jAOX77J/UX%2FUI-OCaml-Learn-Area?type=design&node-id=442%3A1340&mode=design&t=yt0BtayxxyYgW01B-1) (confidential)._\n\n\n**New documentation**\n\nOur main goal is to create user-centric, structured OCaml documentation that helps both new and existing users. This involves collaborative work with the community, testing on interns, and newcomers to refine content from structural level down to code examples.\n\nOur approach includes creating detailed outlines for all documents. We review these outlines internally, and subsequently draft the documentation. The draft of the documentation are reviewed internally before we ask the community to jump in and give feedback. Some example of this can be seen for the new [File Manipulation tutorial](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/help-review-the-new-file-manipulation-tutorial-on-ocaml-org/12638) and [Error Handling guide](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/updating-the-error-handling-tutorial/12022).\n\nWe will follow a similar process for all of the content listed in the work-in-progress [high-level outline](https://hackmd.io/p-JHDQUCSS6z3n2NYa8Qzw) for the new documentation.\n\n_Note: Progress has started in Q2 2023 and can be tracked on the [OCaml.org issue tracker](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues/1415)._\n\n\n### Work Items\n\n```[tasklist]\n### Work Items\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/roadmap/issues/23\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/roadmap/issues/68\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/roadmap/issues/334\n- [ ] https://github.com/tarides/workitems/issues/1104\n```\n\n### Challenges\n\n\n\n* The biggest challenge will be to measure the effectiveness of the changes on the improvements of learning experience. We will measure the pain points, implement changes we believe will address the pain points and measure the impact, but it will be challenging to measure impact on a more granular level.\n\n\n### Deliverables\n\n\n\n* New design for the Learn area are implemented and released\n* New content following the outline for the new documentation are written and published\n\n\n## Effort\n\n\n\n* 0.2 Principal Software Engineer * 24 weeks (Thibaut)\n* 2 Senior Software Engineers * 24 weeks (Cuihtlauac and Sabine)\n* 0.8 UI/UX Designers * 16 weeks (Claire)\n* 1 Software Engineer Apprentice * 12 weeks (Sayo)\n\n\n### Justification\n\nTo make changes to the layout of the Learn Area and to implement the new components that we use to establish visual hierarchy for the documentation content, we assign one junior person - this work revolves around implementing the UI designs created by the UI/UX designer.\n\nThe Senior Software engineers are responsible for writing and revising documentation. Assuming that one completely new document takes 4 days to complete by a single engineer, including revisions, and we also have to create an overall outline that takes the team two weeks to create, this means we may have roughly 20 new documents by the end of the quarter.\n\n\n## Priority\n\nHIGH\n\n\n### Why?\n\nThe documentation has a substantial impact on the adoption of OCaml. Since newcomers searching for OCaml arrive on ocaml.org (thanks to its high page ranking at search engines), it is crucial that these people have an excellent learning experience and receive up-to-date guidance in order to grow the OCaml user base.\n\n\n## Timeline\n\nStarted in Q2 2023, aim to finish end of Q4 2023.\n\n\n## Bucket\n\n\nCommunity\n\n\n## Point of contact\n\n\n\n* Aaron Bauer (abauer@janestreet.com)\n\n\n## Requestor\n\nN/A\n\n\n## Slack channel\n\n[https://ocamllabs.slack.com/archives/C05FWQ9QK4Y](https://ocamllabs.slack.com/archives/C05FWQ9QK4Y)\n\n\n## Approvals\n\n* Yaron Minsky (yminsky@gmail.com) ‚Äì Approved\n* Aaron Bauer (abauer@janestreet.com) ‚Äì Approved","url":"https://github.com/tarides/objectives/issues/64","state":"OPEN"},{"title":"OCaml.org Package Documentation Offers a Painless User Experience","id":"I_kwDOG5OS8s5iXrMd","number":65,"body":"**Why**\r\n\r\n_Why is this objective important_\r\n\r\nA package directory that includes package documentation is a major attraction of any programming language as it helps existing users increase their productivity without having to install any tools.
