# Last week

- Improving syntax error messages for LR-parsers (PhD2)
  - @let-def (5 days)
  - Analyze only selected start symbols:
    - for faster code generation (and marginally smaller automata)
    - for enumeration
  - Fully working coverage check using monotonous functions
  - Merge enumeration in main binary
  - Fixed a bit-twiddling bug in compact (bitmap) representation of sets
