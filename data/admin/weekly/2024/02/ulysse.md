# Last week
This week I also spent time with Pizie to guide him and review his PRs.

- Occurrences and rename (Mer7)
  - @voodoos (3.5 days)
  - Enabled project-wide renaming in LSP. The feature is limited right now as it
    doesn't load files to check syntactic issues as LSP does for the current
    buffer (to correctly rename things like punning).
  - Cleaned up the custom opam switch and prepare all preview release branches
    with latest fixes.
  - Wrote and published a [discuss
    post](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-preview-play-with-project-wide-occurrences-for-ocaml/13814)
    to invite adventurous ocamlers to play with the feature!
  - Continued answering reviews of the compiler PR.
