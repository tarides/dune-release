We need a basic opam project skeleton

    $ cat > CHANGES.md << EOF \
    > ## 0.1.0\
    > \
    > - Some other feature\
    > \
    > ## 0.0.0\
    > \
    > - Some feature\
    > EOF
    $ cat > whatever.opam << EOF \
    > opam-version: "2.0"\
    > homepage: "https://github.com/foo/whatever"\
    > dev-repo: "git+https://github.com/foo/whatever.git"\
    > doc: "https://foo.github.io/whatever/"\
    > description: "whatever"\
    > EOF
    $ touch README
    $ touch LICENSE
    $ cat > dune-project << EOF \
    > (lang dune 2.4)\
    > (name whatever)\
    > EOF

We need to set up a git project for dune-release to work properly

    $ git init > /dev/null
    $ git add CHANGES.md whatever.opam dune-project README LICENSE
    $ git commit -m "Initial commit" > /dev/null
    $ dune-release tag -y
    [-] Extracting tag from first entry in CHANGES.md
    [-] Using tag "0.1.0"
    [+] Tagged HEAD with version 0.1.0

We make a dry-run release

    $ dune-release distrib --dry-run
    [-] Building source archive
    dune-release: [WARNING] The repo is dirty. The distribution archive may be
                            inconsistent. Uncommitted changes to files (including
                            dune-project) will be ignored.
