A necessary condition for dune-release to work is that it's able to infer the main package

  $ touch first_pkg.opam
  $ touch other_pkg.opam

  $ dune-release check --working-tree
  [FAIL] cannot determine distribution name automatically: add (name <name>) to dune-project
  [1]

Make a minimal project set up

  $ rm first_pkg.opam other_pkg.opam
  $ cat > my_pkg.opam <<EOF
  > opam-version: "2.0"
  > dev-repo: "git+https://github.com/fu/fa.git"
  > description: "Some description"
  > maintainer: "me"
  > authors: "also me"
  > homepage: "https://github.com/fu/fa"
  > bug-reports: "https://github.com/fu/fa/issues"
  > synopsis: "Dope project"
  > license: "ISC"
  > EOF
  $ cat > dune-project << EOF 
  > (lang dune 2.7)
  > (name my_pkg)
  > EOF

In multi package projects, the whole lint process (including the file lints, even though they are package independent) is done once for every package

In the same way in which the user can skip the lint check when releasing the tarball, they can also skip it here

  $ dune-release check --working-tree --skip-lint | make_dune_release_deterministic

Create a project with an opam file without dev-repo field

  $ rm my_pkg.opam my_pkg-sub.opam dune-project
  $ echo "opam-version: \"2.0\"" > my_pkg.opam

If the main opam file doesn't contain a dev-repo field, the first check fails

  $ dune-release check --skip-lint --skip-build --working-tree
  [-] Checking dune-release compatibility.
  [FAIL] main package my_pkg.opam is not dune-release compatible. Github development repository URL could not be inferred from opam files.
  Have you provided a github uri in the dev-repo field of your main opam file? If you don't use github, you can still use dune-release for everything but for publishing your release on the web. In that case, have a look at `dune-release delegate-info`.
  [FAIL] The dune project doesn't contain a name stanza. Please, add one.

Add an invalid dev-repo field to the opam file

  $ cat > my_pkg.opam << EOF 
  > opam-version: "2.0"
  > dev-repo: "https://my_homepage.com"
  > EOF

The first check also fails, if the opam file does contain a dev-repo field, but that field isn't in the format of a github dev repo

  $ dune-release check --skip-lint --skip-build --working-tree
  [-] Checking dune-release compatibility.
  [FAIL] main package my_pkg.opam is not dune-release compatible. Github development repository URL could not be inferred from opam files.

  $ cat > my_pkg-ppx.opam << EOF 
  > opam-version: "2.0"
  > dev-repo: "git+https://github.com/fu/fa.git"
  > EOF

The first check only depends on the main package; all subpackages are irrelevant

  $ dune-release check --skip-lint --skip-build --working-tree

  [FAIL] main package my_pkg.opam is not dune-release compatible. Github development repository URL could not be inferred from opam files.

Add a name stanza to the dune-project

  $ cat > dune-project <<EOF 
  > (lang dune 2.8) 
  > (name my_pkg-ppx) 
  > EOF

Which package the main package is can be made clear in the dune-project.
With that, also the second compatibility test passes.

  $ dune-release check --skip-lint --skip-build --working-tree

Make a project which is dune-release compatible on the working tree,
but not dune-release compatible on the last git tag.

  $ rm my_pkg.opam my_pkg-ppx.opam dune-project
  $ echo "opam-version: \"2.0\"" > my_pkg.opam

  $ git init 2> /dev/null > /dev/null
  $ git config user.name "dune-release-test"
  $ git config user.email "pseudo@pseudo.invalid"
  $ git add my_pkg.opam
  $ git commit -m "Initial commit" > /dev/null
  $ git tag -a 0.1.0 HEAD -m "release 0.1.0"

  $ cat > dune-project << EOF
